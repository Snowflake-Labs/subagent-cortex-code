# Cortex Code Integration for Codex

This skill lets Codex delegate Snowflake-specific work to Cortex Code via the `cortexcode-tool` CLI while Codex remains the primary assistant for general coding and local repository tasks.

## Routing Principle

Only Snowflake-specific operations go to Cortex Code. Everything else stays in Codex. The cortexcode-tool automatically handles routing.

## How to use this skill

When this skill triggers, follow this workflow.

### 1. Execute Snowflake queries via cortexcode-tool

Run `cortexcode-tool` as a **foreground command** — do NOT background it with `&`.
Codex automatically waits for long-running commands ("Waited for background terminal").
The command takes 30-90 seconds.

```bash
cortexcode-tool "USER_PROMPT_HERE" --envelope RO --config ~/.local/lib/cortexcode-tool/config.yaml
```

Choose envelope based on operation:
- `RO` for read-only queries (default for most operations)
- `RW` for data modifications or writes
- `RESEARCH` for exploratory work
- `DEPLOY` for deployment operations

**IMPORTANT**: Do not call `cortex -p` directly — it requires interactive stdin and will hang.
**IMPORTANT**: Do not use `& disown` or background execution — Codex cannot track orphaned processes.

### 2. Present results back in Codex

After cortexcode-tool finishes:
- The tool returns clean, formatted output (not JSON)
- Summarize the result clearly for the user
- Include key findings, SQL, errors, or next actions
- Keep Codex as the user-facing orchestrator

**Example output** (stdout only — routing/debug messages go to stderr):
```
You have **64 databases** in your Snowflake account...
```

### 3. Handle non-Snowflake requests locally

For non-Snowflake requests, handle directly using Codex tools:
- Local file reads/writes/edits
- Git operations
- Web or app development unrelated to Snowflake
- General Python, JavaScript, shell, or infrastructure work
- Non-Snowflake databases

## Security expectations

The cortexcode-tool uses built-in security flow:
- Auto-approval mode (approval_mode: "auto")
- Audit logging to ~/.cache/cortexcode-tool/audit.log
- Envelope-based tool restrictions
- Prompt sanitization
- Credential path blocking

Config file location: `~/.local/lib/cortexcode-tool/config.yaml` (written by install.sh, persists across reboots)

## Notes for Codex

- Handle local file operations, git, and non-Snowflake work directly - don't use cortexcode-tool
- For Snowflake queries, use cortexcode-tool with appropriate envelope
- Keep context minimal when invoking Cortex
- cortexcode-tool automatically determines if a query is Snowflake-related
- If a query fails routing or times out, handle locally or explain the limitation

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Permission denied on audit log or cache
**Solution**: Use the provided config (audit/cache go to `~/.cache/cortexcode-tool`):
```bash
--config ~/.local/lib/cortexcode-tool/config.yaml
```

### Error: Cortexcode-tool not found
**Solution**: Run the Codex install script — it installs `cortexcode-tool` automatically:
```bash
bash integrations/codex/install.sh
```

### Query takes too long
**Note**: Queries typically take 30-60 seconds. Codex will wait automatically.
If the command times out, retry once — Snowflake connection may have been cold.

### cortex -p hangs with no output
**Cause**: Direct `cortex -p` invocation may wait for interactive approval in non-TTY terminals.
**Solution**: Use `cortexcode-tool`, which invokes Cortex in stream JSON mode with the configured envelope.

## Examples

**Snowflake database count:**
```bash
cortexcode-tool "How many databases do I have in Snowflake?" --envelope RO --config ~/.local/lib/cortexcode-tool/config.yaml
```

**Query specific database:**
```bash
cortexcode-tool "What tables are in DB_STOCK database?" --envelope RO --config ~/.local/lib/cortexcode-tool/config.yaml
```

**Data modification:**
```bash
cortexcode-tool "Create a backup table of SALES_DATA" --envelope RW --config ~/.local/lib/cortexcode-tool/config.yaml
```
